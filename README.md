# self-assessment
final repo

Our project was on the Social Economic factors leading to performance in the Olympic games.
The point was to see if we could understand the key factors that led to a successful Olympic performance.  
Our final conculsion were that there were multiple reasons why a country is successful.
This was an exciting project.  And it took us a while to get a topic we were all happy with.  I believe the team worked well together.  We had respect for eachother and worked well together.
Leidy and Ahmad did most of the coding.  I was responsible for finding and organizing all the Olympic data. Putting those data sets together.  It was a challenge to gather that data and put it in a usuable form. 
Then I put the dashboard together with Brett.  We both pulled together lots of tables and tried to find some that were important to telling the story.
The team worked together to understand what the data told us and what the next steps were.
Leidy was the default leader of our team, and she kept us all on track.  I'm not sure if we would have finished if it was not for her.
Ahmad was awesome, and came in and pulled the conculsion together.
Brett was ready and willing for anything.  He kept us all in communication.

The greatest challenge for me was finding time for the project.  I just started a new job and balancing that with school, family, and the holiday really took a toll on me.
I also think that the Machine learning portion of this course was the most difficult for me to comprehend.  

But we jelled.  We all did what was needed.  We focused on the rubric and made sure that we had all the topic covered.
